# randomPasswordCreator
In this project, I made a random password creator by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There is a card to create a password in the center of the webpage. When you are creating the password, you can add Upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and characters. Also you can determine the length of your password. End of the process you will see the password on top of the card. 

And here there is a demo website = passwordcreator.rf.gd
